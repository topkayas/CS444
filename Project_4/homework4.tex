\section*{Write-up}
\subsection*{Project 4}


\subsection*{Algorithm}

I imagined this as a movie thether with seatch of varying sizes which symbolizes main memoery. Some seats are small some are for skinny people while some are large and big for larger sizes. There are many people that symbolizes processes waiting outside the theather, waiting to get seated(job) Best fit algorithm chooses the best seat for accordingly. We make sure we give the right seat to the right person, while maybe skipping alot of seats in between.

\subsubsection*{Reflection}
	1. I think the main point was to learn about memoery management..\\
	2. I have watched many devices videos on how to implement best fit algorithm.\\
	3. The VM took awhile to boot up but I was expecting this.\\
	4. I learned how to implement best fir and got myself familirized with best fit algorithm\\
