\section*{Write-up}
\subsection*{Project 3}


\subsection*{Algorithm}

Reading the LDD file that was suggested for us, I was able to create a sbd.c file. This invlves almost all the functions from that document. The most important notes were that I was supposed to this as a module, this module then has to be moved to the virtual mashine using scp.

To create my sbd.c file I have used a blog post and changed it according to my needs.

\subsubsection*{Reflection}
	1. I think the main point was to learn about different types of devices also using crypto API loading modules and using modle parameters..\\
	2. I have watched many devices videos and read alot of blocks on what a block device needs to do, and once I got what functiosn it needs I figured out.\\
	3. Approaching the problem piece by piece made it much easier. What was really frustrating was that I had to keep building the OS over and over again whenever I wanted to test it, so it took alot of time.\\
	4. I learned how to compile and load individual kernel modules, about the crypto API, and how memory devices are handles and the kernel level\\

When & What \\
5/13/2016 & Started with Project 3, I read more about LDD then once that was done I started working on the sbd.c file and patch file.\\
5/15/2016 & I have found a blog post that helped me build my own sdb.\\
5/16/2016 & Everything finally worked well with qemu and Project 3 I have used scp to write on the file.\\
